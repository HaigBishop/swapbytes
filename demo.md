# Demo of SwapBytes

This is an example interaction between two SwapBytes users on the same local machine.

---

### 1. New sessions

Both users have detected each other, but lost connection (as seen by the `[âœ—]`).

One user runs `/me` to get their `multiaddr`. The other user runs `/ping <multiaddr>` to initiate a lasting connection.
